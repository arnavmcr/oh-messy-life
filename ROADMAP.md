## Phase 1.6 — The Record (Journal Archive) `[ IN PROGRESS ]`

> 21 monthly journal entries (Dec 2023–Feb 2026) exported from Notion, to be published as a flagship standalone section. Name "The Record" is a placeholder.

### Design decisions (locked)
- **Archive index** `/record`: numbered issue list, year-grouped, staggered fade-in animation on load, section titles visible as muted subtitle text, brightness dims on older entries, hover turns title red + shows arrow
- **Individual entry** `/record/[slug]`: editorial/magazine long-read, linear scroll, `###` headings rendered as named chapter breaks
- **"What is this and why am I doing this?" section**: collapsed by default, toggle reveals it
- **"Other random things" / "Other fun things"**: distinct bullet-list visual treatment (lighter type, more spacing)
- **Architecture**: `.md` files with YAML frontmatter (gray-matter) + structure-aware section parser. No MDX authoring — frontmatter is the escape hatch for per-entry overrides.

### Content schema — `content/record/*.md`
```yaml
---
title: "March '25"
date: "2025-03-01"
slug: "march-25"
issue: 15
status: published
# optional per-entry overrides:
# featured: true
# note: "short note shown in archive index"
---
```

### Section detection rules (in `lib/journal.ts`)
- Heading contains `"What is this"` (case-insensitive) → `collapsible: true`
- Heading matches `"Other random things"` or `"Other fun things"` (case-insensitive) → `bulletList: true`
- `"Links to previous months"` → strip entirely, do not render
- **Adaptive heading level:** if an entry has no named `###` sections beyond "What is this", `####` headings are promoted to top-level sections automatically. Entries with named `###` sections keep `####` as body subsections.

### Milestones
- [x] Content migration — 21 Notion exports → `content/record/*.md`
- [x] `lib/journal.ts` — section-aware parser: `getAllJournalEntries()`, `getJournalEntry(slug)` with prev/next
- [x] `components/CollapsibleSection.tsx` — client component (`'use client'`) for the collapsible "what is this" toggle
- [x] `app/record/page.tsx` — animated archive index
- [x] `app/record/[slug]/page.tsx` — editorial entry page with `generateStaticParams`
- [x] `components/Nav.tsx` — add RECORD as top-level nav link (no dropdown)
- [x] Add `.superpowers/` to `.gitignore`

### Milestone 1.7 — Homepage Changelog ✓
- [x] `content/changelog.json` — manual SITE-type entries
- [x] `lib/changelog.ts` — merges WRITING + RECORD + SITE entries, sorts by date desc, slices to limit
- [x] `components/Changelog.tsx` — terminal-feed Server Component, color-coded type labels (WRITING=red, RECORD=purple, SITE=green), no client JS
- [x] Wired into `app/page.tsx` between hero and content grid

### Milestone 1.8 — Nav fixes ✓
- [x] Category pages for `projects`, `mba`, `essays`, `music` — `[slug]/page.tsx` now dual-purpose: detects category keys and renders listing view, otherwise renders article
- [x] Writing dropdown hover gap fixed — replaced CSS `group-hover` with JS state + 150ms close delay

---

## Phase 2 — Labs (Projects) `[ PLANNED ]`

> Showcase work with varying levels of interactivity.

### Milestones
- [ ] `/projects` — THE LABS listing page (grid of project cards)
- [ ] `/projects/[slug]` — THE LAB_ENTRY template (MDX for case studies)
- [ ] Live embed component (sandboxed iframe with fallback)
- [ ] Graph visualisation component (D3, lazy-loaded)
- [ ] Integrate projects into THE NEXUS home

---

## Phase 3 — Signal (Music) `[ IN PROGRESS ]`

> `/music` currently proxies entirely to `arnav-music-library.vercel.app` via Next.js rewrite. Being restructured into a proper section with a landing page and sub-routes.

### Milestone 3.0 — Nav + Landing + Library rewrite `[ PARTIAL ✓ ]`
- [x] Promote SIGNAL in `Nav.tsx` from `comingSoon` span to real link with dropdown (Library + greyed stubs for Gig Archive, T-shirt Archive)
- [x] `app/music/page.tsx` — THE SIGNAL landing page with links to sub-sections
- [x] Library rewrite — not needed. External app has `base href="/music/"`, page file handles `/music`, rewrite handles `/music/:path*` sub-routes. No config change required.

### 3a — Gig Archive `[ PLANNED ]`
- Gallery grid of gig photos (filterable by year/venue), lightbox on click
- `app/music/gig-archive/page.tsx`

### 3b — T-shirt Archive `[ PLANNED ]`
- `app/music/tshirt-archive/page.tsx`

### 3c — Library Browser (existing, being moved)
- External app at `arnav-music-library.vercel.app`, proxied to `/music/library`

---

## Phase 4 — Codex (Professional Journey) `[ EXPLORATORY ]`

> Non-linear career story. Career changer — the messiness *is* the point.

### Milestones
- [ ] Decide on visualisation approach (constellation vs timeline vs scrolling narrative)
- [ ] `/about` — THE CODEX page

---

## Phase 5 — Polish + Growth `[ FUTURE ]`

- [ ] Real domain + DNS on Vercel
- [ ] OG images per page (Vercel OG)
- [ ] RSS feed for writing + record
- [ ] Search (Fuse.js client-side)
- [ ] "TERMINAL" easter egg (fake CLI, keyboard navigable)
- [ ] Analytics (Plausible or Fathom)
- [ ] Performance audit (Core Web Vitals)

## Decisions Log
| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-03-21 | Next.js App Router | Vercel-native, SSG-friendly |
| 2026-03-21 | MDX + gray-matter (no CMS) | Content in repo, version-controlled |
| 2026-03-21 | Full technical vandalism aesthetic | Committed to Stitch direction |
| 2026-03-21 | Dark mode both (user-toggled) | Accessibility + preference |
| 2026-03-21 | WP content under `college` category | All WP content is undergraduate-era writing |
| 2026-03-22 | Journal section uses `.md` not `.mdx` | Pure prose, no JSX needed; structure-aware parser gives more control |
| 2026-03-22 | Journal frontmatter as escape hatch | Auto-structure by default, manual override when needed per entry |
| 2026-03-22 | Journal as flagship IP ("The Record") | Name is placeholder — will change; treat as premium standalone section |
| 2026-03-22 | Adaptive `###`/`####` section splitting in parser | Newer entries evolved to use `####` for all sections except "What is this"; fixed parser to detect this and promote `####` to top-level when no named `###` sections exist |
| 2026-03-22 | Medium posts use `projects`, `mba`, `essays` categories (not `college`) | Medium writing is post-grad era; taxonomy will continue to evolve |
| 2026-03-22 | Medium images self-hosted in `public/images/<slug>/` | Avoids dependency on miro.medium.com CDN going away |
| 2026-03-22 | Substack "After EOD" posts (6) under new top-level `music` category | These are 2024–2026 posts, distinct from `college → music` (2014–2019); `/music` is a planned route |
| 2026-03-22 | Substack images self-hosted in `public/images/<slug>/` | Avoids dependency on substackcdn.com CDN |
| 2026-03-22 | Hero redesigned: removed tech-jargon two-column workbench | Aesthetic shifted from hacker/systems to raw/personal soft-punk; "oh messy life." replaces "THE NEXUS" as the visual anchor |
| 2026-03-23 | THE MANUSCRIPT redesigned: removed sidebar, centered single-column | Based on "Refined Portfolio Article" Stitch reference; sidebar felt like dev tool, not reading experience; drop cap + floating pill added |
| 2026-03-24 | Homepage changelog: hybrid auto-derived + manual, terminal feed aesthetic | Auto-derives WRITING/RECORD entries from content files; manual `changelog.json` for SITE entries; pure Server Component, no client JS; 10 entries below hero |
| 2026-03-25 | SIGNAL nav: plain `<a>` for `/music/index.html` (not Next.js `<Link>`) | Avoids prefetch of the external library app; drop-in rewrite handles the proxy, no config change needed |
| 2026-03-29 | Reading pill extracted to `ReadingPill.tsx` client component | Enables Web Share API + clipboard fallback for share, localStorage text-size preference, localStorage bookmark toggle |
